## Introduction 
This is a full-stack task management system which is built with Next.js react for frontend and supabase for backend. The application features a Kanban board interface for visualising workflow, user authencation for login and real-time taks management capabilities. 

## Project Aim & Objectives
The main goal is to create a secure, scalable teask management platform which enhances team productivity. 
Key objectives:
1. Implement secure user authentication and authorisation
2. Create a intuitive Kanban board interface for task visualisation
3. Provide user assignee to tasks
4. Addng security and error handling 
## Future improvements
For future improvements there are few things that I can improve/enhance which are:
1. Create user roles so all users that have access to the board can onlt view users and not add, edit or delete them. Only the manager can add,edit and delete users.
2. Adding filtering and search functionality to help find tickets or user much easier.
